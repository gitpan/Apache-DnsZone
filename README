DnsZone is a fully functional application for Apache/mod_perl. 
It implements a web based interface for managing zones with a nameserver 
running BIND.

DnsZone is released under the Perl Artistic License.

DnsZone aims to not create additional security holes with your current 
BIND installation and therefore does not have any programs running on 
the actual nameserver. All updates are done through dyanmic dns updates 
(RFC: 2136). This is implemented through Michael Fuhrs excellent 
Net::DNS::Update module. Attached to this module is the following 
disclaimer: "WARNING: This code is still under development and shouldn't
be used to maintain a production nameserver." 
That is why we cannot guarantee that DnsZone will work 100% for you. 
Furthermore it is advised to read the SECURITY file that is shipped with
the distribution.
We have though had pretty good experiences with DnsZone.

If you are aware of any bugs or errors in DnsZone please report them to

When you report bugs please set DnsZoneDebugLevel to 10 and include the 
output where the error is produced. Patches are of course welcome.
